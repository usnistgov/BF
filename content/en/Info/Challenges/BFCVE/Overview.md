# BFCVE Challenges 
## Towards a BF Labeled Dataset of Software Security Vulnerabilities<br/>_`Irena Bojanova, Inventor/Creator, PI & Lead, NIST Bugs Framework (BF), 2014 â€“ ~~~~`_

Create a comprehensively labeled dataset of software security vulnerability specifications using BF's [formalism (taxonomy and LL(1) formal grammar)](/BF/info/bf-classes/).

The [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)](https://www.cve.org/) repository has 228 000 software vulnerability entrees (as of August 2023) and 25K+ are being added each year. Systematic labeling of this huge set of CVEs benefits greatly the advances in modern artificial intelligence (AI) Cybersecurity research. The [National Vulnerability Database (NVD)](https://nvd.nist.gov/), with input from the security community, labels CVEs with [Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)](https://cwe.mitre.org/) entries. However, this has proven to be difficult as CWE has imprecise descriptions, gaps and overlaps in covarage.
