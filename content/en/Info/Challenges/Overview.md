# BF Challenges -- Contribute your time and tallent!<br/>_`Irena Bojanova, Inventor/Creator, PI & Lead, NIST Bugs Framework (BF), 2014 â€“ ~~~~`_

CWE2BF challenge: Create CWE2BF mappings and unambigous BFCWE specifications. Start creating matrices of meaningful (cause, operation, consequence) BF weakness triples.
BFCVE challenge: Create a comprehensively labeled dataset of software security vulnerability specifications using BF's [formalism (taxonomy and LL(1) formal grammar)](/BF/info/bf-classes/).
BF Backtracking: Create tools bactracking from failure to bug utilizing the BE taxonomy, and causation and propagation rules - including BF matrices of meaningful (cause, operation, conseqeunce) weakness triples.
BFAI: Create ML & AI tools for automated generation of unambiguous BFCVE vulnerability specifications.
