# BF Vulnerability Specification Model <br/>_`Irena Bojanova, PI & Lead, NIST Bugs Framework (BF), 2014 – ~~~~`_

The BF software security vulnerability specification model is presented on Figure 1. Following the [BF definitions](/BF/info/vulnerability-model/bf-concepts/) of bug, fault, error, and weakness, a software security vulnerability is modeled as a causal chain of underlying weaknesses that leads to a security failure. A security bug causes the first weakness, leading to an error. This error becomes the cause (i.e., the fault) for a next weakness and propagates through subsequent weaknesses until a final/exploitable error is reached, causing the security failure.

<!-- In some cases, several vulnerabilities must be present for an exploit to be harmful. The final errors resulting from different chains converge to cause a failure (see  Figure 2). The bug in at least one of the chains must be fixed to avoid that failure.   -->

<!-- The detailed model of a formal BF specification of a software security vulnerability with N underlying weaknesses is presented on Figure 2.  -->

 The bug is an improper opration. A fault is an improper operand. The operation defect type can be code or specification. The operand fault type can be name, data, type, address, or size. ‘Name’ is about a resolved or bound object, function, data type, or namespace; ‘data’, ‘type’, ‘address’, and ‘size’ are about an object.

Exploitation of a vulnerability may result in a fault causing a next vulnerability of only fault type weaknesses. The bug in the first vulnerability must be fixed to avoid the failure. 
Occasionally, for an exploit to be harmful, several vulnerabilities must converge at their final errors. The bug in at least one of the chains must be fixed to avoid the failure.
