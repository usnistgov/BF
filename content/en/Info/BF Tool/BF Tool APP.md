# BF Tool APP for Formal Specification of Security Vulnerabilities<br/> _`Irena Bojanova, Inventor/Creator, PI & Lead, NIST Bugs Framework (BF), 2014 â€“ ~~~`_

The BF Tool APP is a Web application allows users to create a new BF Vulnerability specification, save it in the BF database, download it as a machine-readable base (.bfv), full (.bfvul), or core (.bff) XML or JSON file format, and open or upload and browse previously created BF specifications.

The BF Tool APP demonstrates how the BF taxonomy and causation and propagation rules tie together into the strict BF formal language. It uses the BFVUL tool functionality to generate graphical representations of the BF formal specifications to enhance understanding.
