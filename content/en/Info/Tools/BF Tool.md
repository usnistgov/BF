# BF GUI Tool for Formal Vulnerability Specification <br/>_`Irena Bojanova, Inventor/Creator, PI & Lead, NIST Bugs Framework (BF), 2014 â€“ ~~~~`_

//to be added//

<!-- BF is a classification system of software and hardware bugs and faults that allows formal speification of security vulnerabilities exploiting such weaknesses.

The BF Tool facilitates the use of the BF taxonomy in describing security vulnerabilities according to the BF [Vulnerability Model](/BF/info/vulnerability-model/bf-vulnerability-model/). It guides the creation of BF vulnerability decryptions and graphical representations (e.g. in [BFCVE](/BF/info/bfcve) on the left). The BF Tool is in C#, and will run on current MS Windows OS. 

To obtain the BF tool, please register here. We ask you only for an email address, organization, and purpose.
