			<td>Verify </td>
	<td>Verify operation – Check data semantics (e.g., proper value/meaning) in order to accept (and possibly correct) or reject it.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
			<td>Correct </td>
	<td>Correct operation – Modify data (e.g., assign new value or remove) to make it accurate.</td>

			<td><strong>Causes</strong></td>
	<td><strong>Definition</strong></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
			<td>Code Bug</td>
	<td>Code Bug type – An error in the implementation of an operation – proper operands over an improper operation. It is the roor cause of a security vulnerability. Must be fixed to resolve the vulnerability.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
			<td>   Missing Code </td>
	<td>Missing Code bug - The operation is misplaced entirely absent.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
			<td>   Erroneous Code </td>
	<td>Erroneous Code bug - There is a coding error in the implementation of the operation.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
			<td>Specification Bug</td>
	<td>Specification Bug type – A defect in the metadata or algorithm of an operation – proper operands over an improper operation. It is the roor cause of a security vulnerability. It must be fixed to resolve the vulnerability.</td>

			<td>Data Fault</td>
	<td>Data error (or fault) type – The data of an object has harmed semantics or inconsistent or wrong value.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
			<td>   Invalid Data </td>
	<td>Invalid Data error (or fault) – The data has harmed syntax due to validation or sanitization errors.</td>

	<tr>
			<td>Data Error</td>
	<td>Data error (or fault) type – The data of an object has harmed semantics or inconsistent or wrong value.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
			<td>   Wrong Value </td>
	<td>Wrong Value error (or fault) – The data value is not accurate (e.g., outside of a range).</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
			<td>   Inconsistent Value </td>
	<td>Inconsistent Value error (or fault) – The data value does not correspond to related data value (e.g., inconstancy between the value of a size variable and the actual buffer size).</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
			<td>Type Error</td>
	<td>Type error (or fault) type – The set or range of allowed values of an entity is wrong or the operations allowed on them are wrong.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
			<td>   Wrong Type </td>
	<td>Wrong Type error (or fault) – A data type range or structure is not correct.</td>

			<td>   Value </td>
	<td>Value operation attribute – The operation checks data for a specific value (incl. NULL or list of values).</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
			<td>   Quantity </td>
	<td>Quantity operation attribute – The operation checks data for a specific measurable value (e.g., size, time, rate, frequency).</td>
