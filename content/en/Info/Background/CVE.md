# Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) is "a dictionary of publicly known information security vulnerabilities and exposures" [1]. "CVE's common identifiers enable data exchange between security products and provide a baseline index point for evaluating coverage of tools and services." [1]

## Examples

### CVE-2014-0160 (Heartbleed)

> "The (1) TLS and (2) DTLS implementations in OpenSSL 1.0.1 before 1.0.1g do not properly handle Heartbeat Extension packets, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from process memory via crafted packets that trigger a buffer over-read, as demonstrated by reading private keys, related to d1\_both.c and t1\_lib.c, aka the Heartbleed bug." [2]

### CVE 2007-3572 (Yoggie Pico)

> "Incomplete blacklist vulnerability in cgi-bin/runDiagnostics.cgi in the web interface on the Yoggie Pico and Pico Pro allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters in the param parameter, as demonstrated by URL encoded "`" (backtick) characters (%60 sequences)." [3]
