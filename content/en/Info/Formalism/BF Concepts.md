# BF Security Concepts<br/>_`Irena Bojanova, Inventor/Creator, PI & Lead, NIST Bugs Framework (BF), 2014 – ~~~~`_

`A BF _security bug_ or _weakness type_ relates to a distinct software, firmware (including microcode), or hardware circuit logic _execution phase_ defined by a set of BF operations and their input operands and output results.  
 
A BF _operation_ is the minimal input-process-output code that can produce or propagate an improper _name_, _data_, _type_, _address_, or _size_.`

The BF defines the concepts of bug, fault, error, final error, weakness, vulnerability, exploit vector, and failure in the context of cybersecurity to provide the level of detail and granularity needed to understand the causation within a weakness and the causation and propagation between weaknesses and between vulnerabilities. 

- A _security bug_ is a code or specification defect (i.e., an operation defect) in software, firmware, or hardware circuit logic — that is, proper operands over an improper operation. The specification includes the operation metadata and algorithm. 

  A bug could be introduced by a programmer, result from a design flaw, or be induced by a hardware defect (e.g., due to overheating). A bug could also resurface from a design flaw (e.g., an unaccounted-for system configuration or environment).

- A _fault_ is a name, data, type, address, or size error (i.e., an operand error) — that is, an improper operand over a proper operation. 

  A fault could result from a bug or another fault or be induced by a hardware defect. In the case of low-level storage (e.g., cache and CPU registers), there is no _type_ fault. 

- An _error_ is the result of an operation with a bug or faulty operand that propagates to a fault of an operand of another operation.

- A _security final error_ is an undefined or exploitable system behavior. A final error results from an operation with a bug or faulty operand. 

- A _security weakness_ is a ⟨bug, operation⟩→error, ⟨fault, operation⟩→error, ⟨bug, operation⟩→final error, or ⟨fault, operation⟩→final error causal triple.

- A _security vulnerability_ is a causal chain of weaknesses that starts with a bug or hardware defect-induced fault, propagates through errors that become faults, and ends with a final error that introduces an exploit vector. 

  The first weakness concerns the root cause of the vulnerability, and the last weakness concerns its sink.

- A _security exploit vector_ is the pathway for the exploitation of a vulnerability.

- A _security failure_ is a violation of a system security requirement caused by the exploitation of a security vulnerability. 

The BF security concept definitions are contextually visualized in Figure 1. Following the blue solid initial arrow, a security vulnerability may start with a software or firmware _security bug_ (i.e., a code or specification defect within an operation). Following the green dashed arrow, a vulnerability chain may also start from a hardware defect-induced _fault_.

Fixing the bug or hardware defect-induced fault will resolve the vulnerability, as well as any other vulnerability with the same root cause. Fixing a propagated fault, including the cause of the final error at the sink, will only mitigate the vulnerability. Occasionally, several vulnerabilities must converge at their final errors for an exploit to be harmful. Fixing the bug or starting fault of at least one of the chains would avoid the failure. An exploit of a vulnerability may result in a fault starting a new faults-only vulnerability. Fixing the bug or starting fault of the first vulnerability will resolve the entire chain of vulnerabilities.
